# sql-challenge

The joins proved to be a good challenge, having to run multiple ones in some of the queries.

The challenge stated that there is a sneaking suspicion that the data set maybe a fake, or at least that it was a bit of a test.

In running the various queries a few things stood out as a bit anomalous:
- that there are 20 employees with the first name Hercules and a last name that starts with 'B'
- the most frequent last names in the database are extremely uncommon or even made up
- 13,821 employees hired in one year (1986) seems high 

I did not run the visualizations.
